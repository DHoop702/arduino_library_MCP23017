Button handling library for the MicroChip MCP23017 port expander
Buttons are on PORTA
Now has outputs on PORTB

Read the comments spread amongst the library files for a better understanding

Can be easily modified for use with the MCP12S17 or the 8 bit variants (MCP23008/MCP23S08)
(Will probably do it in the future)
